## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git runs in the background keeping track of all changes made in a project folder and allows you to commit changes, which allows you to have a freeze frame to go back to, and do multiple things like copy a repository into your folder, push updates to github, create new files, and other things you'd do with something similar like command prompt.
 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
GitHub is a hub for gits.  :)
Git is used to control things and make changes to your project and GitHub is where your project is stored and viewed by everyone working on it (or people who want to fork it and make their own changes).

3. Why do we create a branch?
The most intuitive reason to make a branch is if multiple people are on the same project.  Each person can have their own branch and their edits are separate from the other branches and they can be later merged into one file.  You can also use branches to separate sections of a project if you're the only person working on the project.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
Pull request is asking for your changes to be sent to the master project so those working on it can review what you've done and potentially merge it into the existing project.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
checkout

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
I...that wasn't in the lesson at all.  I'm going to guess that the difference is what the person pulling/fetching/merging is trying to do in the request.

7. What is a merge conflict?
If the same line has been changed, one of them has to override.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Let them fight it out with knives probably. (This also wasn't in the lesson.)
